Lithium Music Production Center
================================

Music at your fingertips.

DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------

Lithium uses the LeapMotion sensor to create a virtual sampler
that is controlled using hand gestures. These gestures are based
on finger tap movements of the right hand and the sound emitted
is chosen by the finger that is registered as moving by the
LeapMotion sensor.

FEATURES
--------------------------------

* Play 5 different sounds (Kickdrum, Hi Hat, Cowbell, Clap, and
Snare Drum)

* Play over background music that comes packaged with the program
(can be toggled)

* Different functions for different hands: the right hand controls
the sounds while the left hand controls the volume of the sounds

* The option to toggle between text output and image output when
creating sounds

* Compatible on both Mac OS and Windows

* Portable
